# HomeWork One for The Fundamental Practice of Software engineering Innovation
>By CharlesW

People have developed many a set of tools to help simplify the building of webpages, and React as a a javascript library ranks among them.

Before learning the contents of this library I have no knowledge of other UI tool packs, so this is virtually a brand new realm of knowledge to explore to me. Also because of my insufficient knowledge in and lack of practice of Javascript and html, the report will mostly be what I've learned about React and comparison between what I already know about the basic functions of Javascript and what I've learned about the functions of React.
